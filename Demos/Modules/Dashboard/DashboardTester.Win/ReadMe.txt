Project Description

The DashboardTester.Win project implements a Windows Forms application. The root project folder 
contains the WinApplication.cs(vb) file with the class that inherits 
WinApplication. This class can be designed with the Application Designer that 
allows you to view and customize application components: referenced modules, 
security settings, data connection. Additionally, the root folder contains 
Application Model difference files (XAFML files) that keep application settings 
specific for the current application. Differences files can be designed with 
the Model Editor.
