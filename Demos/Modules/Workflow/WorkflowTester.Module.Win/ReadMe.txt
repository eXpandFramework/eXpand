Project Description

The WorkflowTester.Module.Win project implements a Windows Forms Module. Platform-specific application 
elements can be implemented here (Controllers, Editors & View Items, etc.). 
The root project folder contains the WinModule.cs(vb) file with the class that 
inherits ModuleBase. This class can be designed with the Module Designer that 
allows you to view and customize Module components: referenced modules, 
Controllers and business classes. Additionally, the root folder contains 
Application Model difference files (XAFML files) that keep application 
settings specific for the current Module. Differences files can be designed 
with the Model Editor.
