XAF is a domain specific language that can translate business requirements to technology. Therefore certain artifacts (Controllers,actions,bussiness objects, permission, model etc) exist so we can do the bussiness to technology translation.

This application maps the XAF artifact domain and is applied to the eXpandFramework assemblies (feel free to use it in other XAF frameworks)..

It is amazing how fast you can learn about expandframework by simply going through the navigation views.

Xpand.Docs project follows the usual no code approach and is fully integrated to eXpandFramework continous integration process and distributed from the online repositories.

As you can see in the source code there is a very simple yet powerful configuration through permissions that allows edit only to owned documents you cannot create artifacts since they are auto populated from the parsed assemblies.
