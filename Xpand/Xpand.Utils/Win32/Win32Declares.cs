            /// <remarks>Each workstation has a local ROT that maintains a table of the objects that have been registered as running on that machine. This function returns an IRunningObjectTable interface pointer, which provides access to that table. Moniker providers, which hand out monikers that identify objects so they are accessible to others, should call GetRunningObjectTable. Use the interface pointer returned by this function to register your objects when they begin running, to record the times that those objects are modified, and to revoke their registrations when they stop running. See the IRunningObjectTable interface for more information.Compound-document link sources are the most common example of moniker providers. These include server applications that support linking to their documents (or portions of a document) and container applications that support linking to embeddings within their documents. Server applications that do not support linking can also use the ROT to cooperate with container applications that support linking to embeddings. If you are implementing the IMoniker interface to write a new moniker class, and you need an interface pointer to the ROT, call IBindCtx::GetRunningObjectTable rather than the GetRunningObjectTable function. This allows future implementations of the IBindCtx interface to modify binding behavior</remarks>

This parameter must be a window handle or one of the following values.HWND_BOTTOM Places the window at the bottom of the Z order. If the hWnd parameter identifies a topmost window, the window loses its topmost status and is placed at the bottom of all other windows.HWND_NOTOPMOST Places the window above all non-topmost windows (that is, behind all topmost windows). This flag has no effect if the window is already a non-topmost window.HWND_TOP Places the window at the top of the Z order.HWND_TOPMOST Places the window above all non-topmost windows.

SWP_ASYNCWINDOWPOS If the calling thread and the thread that owns the window are attached to different input queues, the system posts the request to the thread that owns the window. This prevents the calling thread from blocking its execution while other threads process the request. SWP_DEFERERASE Prevents generation of the WM_SYNCPAINT message. SWP_DRAWFRAME Draws a frame (defined in the window's class description) around the window.SWP_FRAMECHANGED Applies new frame styles set using the SetWindowLong function. Sends a WM_NCCALCSIZE message to the window, even if the window's size is not being changed. If this flag is not specified, WM_NCCALCSIZE is sent only when the window's size is being changed.
            /// SWP_HIDEWINDOW Hides the window.SWP_NOACTIVATE Does not activate the window. If this flag is not set, the window is activated and moved to the top of either the topmost or non-topmost group (depending on the setting of the hWndInsertAfter parameter).SWP_NOCOPYBITS Discards the entire contents of the client area. If this flag is not specified, the valid contents of the client area are saved and copied back into the client area after the window is sized or repositioned.SWP_NOMOVE  Retains the current position (ignores X and Y parameters).SWP_NOOWNERZORDER Does not change the owner window's position in the Z order.SWP_NOREDRAW Does not redraw changes. If this flag is set, no repainting of any kind occurs. This applies to the client area, the nonclient area (including the title bar and scroll bars), and any part of the parent window uncovered as a result of the window being moved. When this flag is set, the application must explicitly invalidate or redraw any parts of the window and parent window that need redrawing.SWP_NOREPOSITION Same as the SWP_NOOWNERZORDER flag.SWP_NOSENDCHANGING Prevents the window from receiving the WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING message.SWP_NOSIZE Retains the current size (ignores the cx and cy parameters).SWP_NOZORDER Retains the current Z order (ignores the hWndInsertAfter parameter).SWP_SHOWWINDOW Displays the window.</param>
