Because of the conceptual design of NthIncludedDayTrigger, it is not always possible to decide with certainty that the trigger will never fire again. Therefore, it will search for the next fire time up to a given cutoff. These cutoffs can be changed by using the NextFireCutoffInterval method. The default cutoff is 12 of the intervals specified by IntervalType intervalType
In most cases, the default value of this setting (12) is sufficient (it is highly unlikely, for example, that you will need to look at more than 12 months of dates to ensure that your trigger will never fire again). However, this setting is included to allow for the rare exceptions where this might not be true. 
For example, if your trigger is associated with a calendar that excludes a great many dates in the next 12 months, and hardly any following that, it is possible (if N is large enough) that you could run into this situation.
